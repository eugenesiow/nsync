#summary Feature list for nsync

<wiki:toc max_depth="1" />

== Synchronization ==
  * 2-way synchronization (Sync two folders)
  * Update functionality (update both folders with the latest versions of documents and files)
  * Space check (checks if there is available space for synchronization)

== Easy to use, Intuitive, fast and attractive interface ==

  * Regular folder browsing where you click and select the source/destination folder.
  * Apart from the regular folder browsing, nsync also comes with a Drag and Drop feature (Folders can be dragged from anywhere in Windows into nsync and it is capable of recognizing them)
  * To minimise the untidiness and make the interface look smooth and clean, nsync automatically displays the sync button only when both source and destination folders have been chosen.

== Intelligent Help System ==

  * An in-built help function to provide help and timely information throughout the software. Beats reading a 1000-page help file!
