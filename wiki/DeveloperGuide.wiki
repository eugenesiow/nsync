#summary A developer's definitive guide for diving into nsync internals

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Overview =

nsync is a free, open source file synchronization software for Windows running on the Microsoft .NET platform.

nsync allows the synchronization of your data between desktop PCs, laptops, USB drives and more. We pride our software in being built ‘by users, for users’. Hence, we have come out with an ‘elegant and easy-to-use’ interface, which does synchronization ‘reliably and intelligently’. The product has specially been designed by keeping the novice user in mind.

nsync is a minimalistic product capable of performing synchronization and other tasks with just a few clicks. Following our brand name – nsync (synchronization made easy) is capable of synchronizing a number of devices with ease.

After careful market research and segmentation, we decided to deliver a simple and easy-to- use intuitive software/product – nsync with essential and accessible features and sufficient customization options. Novice users (our target population) are not completely comfortable with the intricacies of the PC and are only concerned with maintaining their files synchronized on multiple PC’s (like home PC, office PC etc) and they aim to get it done fast in this busy world. So nsync is devoid of any useless feature which doesn’t bother the user. Unlike other softwares, nsync has a very sleek and clean interface with an intuitive drag-and-drop design.

nsync does not aim to provide many advanced features, thereby compromising with the quality of each because the producers of the software believe in providing the best out of what is actually required and in the best possible way.

== This is the nsync way ==

Here we present to you not just our product, but our vision too. We hope to make this yours as well and we promise it’ll take just 3 minutes of your time!

 * *Be minimalistic* 
  * The less there is on the interface, the better. Put what’s really needed up there.
 * *Don’t prompt, make intelligent guesses*
  * Notify the users that we’ve made a guess and allow them to make their own decisions. Do this gently and unassumingly.
 * *Make it pretty*
  * Packaging is important; make it eye-catching but not overly or offensively so.
 * *Understandable* 
  * No manual or instructions should be needed.
 * *Fast*
  * Synchronization has to be fast.
 * *Stick to the above principles!* 
  *We are engineers, designers and programmers, but above all, we’re users too. Put the user first.

== Functionality Overview ==
=== V0.0 ===
This was the most basic nsync tool, with a 2-way synchronization function; an easy-to-use, intuitive, fast and attractive interface. The version is already out. The functionalities of the few implemented features in this version are listed below in detail:

==== Synchronization ====
 * 2-way synchronization (Sync two folders)
 * Update functionality (update both folders with the latest versions of documents and files)
 * Space check (checks if there is available space for synchronization)

==== Easy to use, intuitive, fast and attractive interface ====
 * Regular folder browsing where you click and select the source/destination folder.
 * Apart from the regular folder browsing, nsync also comes with a Drag and Drop feature (Folders can be dragged from anywhere in Windows into nsync and it is capable of recognizing them)
 * To minimise the untidiness and make the interface look smooth and clean, nsync automatically displays the sync button only when both source and destination folders have been chosen.

==== nsync remembers what you sync ====
 * Even after being closed and then opened again, nsync remembers your last synced folders (the source and the destination folder)

==== Sync using a removable drive ====
 * nsync is capable of syncing a removable drive with other folders on the computer.

=== V0.9 ===
This was an internal beta release with more refined features. It wasn’t released to the public because the software was undergoing a testing phase to find the various bugs/enhancements in its functionality, GUI, etc. The first public release after resolving all the bugs would be v1.0.
The added functionalities of the various features are listed below in detail:

==== Intelligence ====
 * nsync’s differentiating factor among the other synchronization tools is its intelligence which makes it stand apart. There exists an in built powerful help function to provide help and timely information throughout the software. Beats reading a 1000 page help file!
 * When left folder is a subfolder of right folder or vice versa, it does not allow the sync process to continue so as to prevent an infinite loop.
 * It also alerts the user in the case of an operation being performed incorrectly. Eg: If a user is trying to sync the same folders, the help guide pops up an unobtrusive message window saying “The left and right folder cannot be similar”
 * It allows you to continue with your other work while the sync process is being carried and a notification saying “sync done” pops up in front of your active window as soon as the sync is done.
 * It saves you time in identifying the already synchronized folders and alerts if they are up to date.
 * It checks and reports if one or more of the selected folders has been moved/does not exist by displaying an appropriate message.

==== Additional UI features ====
 * Folder icon changes accordingly if the selected folders are missing/do not exist. Even on driving in a removable drive or selecting a folder within a removable drive using the folder browsing technique, the folder icon changes to that of a removable drive.
 * To keep track of the sync operation, we have 3 indication bars at the bottom of the interface – status bar (displays status messages like preparing folders/syncing folders/sync completed), progress bar and percentage bar (shows sync progress in percentage)
 * The progress bar is so designed that it fills up the team 14 logo orange as sync proceeds. It makes it more appealing to the eye thereby conveying the information to the user about a sync operation’s progress.
 * A slider window to access different pages mainly Settings, Main Window and Track Back (to be included in the next release). When we move the mouse over the left and right side of the interface, a small button appears clicking on which makes you slide to the next page in line up. On mouse click and hold, the image of the button becomes depressed.
 * When the user reaches the leftmost/rightmost page of nsync, the left/right slider bar won’t appear at all respectively.
 * Another way to navigate through the interface pages is by the use of dots (Navidots). These appear at the top part of the interface and clicking on them, you can directly jump to any page out of Settings, Main Window and Track Back (to be included in the next release).
 * Last 5 successfully synced folders are saved in a MRU (Most Recently Used) list which can be accessed by moving the mouse over the folder space.
 * The MRU list also takes care of not having any duplicate folder pairs in the last 5 synced pairs.
 * To avoid any hang up or crashing and to prevent the user from committing any mistake unknowingly, the interface disables the scrolling buttons, the Navidots and the MRU list box while syncing. Also, you can minimize or move the main window/interface while syncing but cannot close the application.
 * Tool Tip feature - It displays the functionality of each and every button as you scroll the mouse over it.
 * Long folder path names are truncated automatically to avoid giving a messy look in the MRU, instead all folder paths would have a tooltip displaying their full folder path.
 * The helper/notification window resets its position according to how we drag the main window. It either fits itself at the top or the bottom of the interface window.

==== Settings page ====
 * Allows the users to enable/disable features and change settings according to their wish. For example, users can choose to have the helper window (notifications) on/off (v1.0)
 * Future options would be to allow users to toggle features like Track Back (v2.0), exclude (v2.0), etc.

=== V1.0 ===
This is the first public release of our software. It comes directly after v0.9 containing the same features as the last release but with all the bugs and enhancements incorporated in v1.0
The list of all the bugs and the enhancements added in our product can be found in the Appendices column (Appendix D)

Since this is a public release, our software which is free and open source could be used by anyone and everyone. The source code, developer and user guide, along with the executable file would be available for download from the GCPH. After this, accumulating the various inputs from the end users etc, we would try to refine our product further by improving upon our current release while going towards v2.0

We also plan to include more features in our second and last public release, v2.0, which are listed on the next page.

=== V2.0 ===
v2.0 is nsync’s second and the final public release. The fully packaged software is available on our website. It aims our target users and has been designed with a consistent idea of keeping it simple, elegant and easy-to-use.
The functionalities of various other added features we propose in v2.0 are listed below:
