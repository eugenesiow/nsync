#summary A developer's definitive guide for diving into nsync internals

<wiki:toc max_depth="1" />

= Overview =

nsync is a free, open source file synchronization software for Windows running on the Microsoft .NET platform.

nsync allows the synchronization of your data between desktop PCs, laptops, USB drives and more. We pride our software in being built ‘by users, for users’. Hence, we have come out with an ‘elegant and easy-to-use’ interface, which does synchronization ‘reliably and intelligently’. The product has specially been designed by keeping the novice user in mind.

nsync is a minimalistic product capable of performing synchronization and other tasks with just a few clicks. Following our brand name – nsync (synchronization made easy) is capable of synchronizing a number of devices with ease.

After careful market research and segmentation, we decided to deliver a simple and easy-to- use intuitive software/product – nsync with essential and accessible features and sufficient customization options. Novice users (our target population) are not completely comfortable with the intricacies of the PC and are only concerned with maintaining their files synchronized on multiple PC’s (like home PC, office PC etc) and they aim to get it done fast in this busy world. So nsync is devoid of any useless feature which doesn’t bother the user. Unlike other softwares, nsync has a very sleek and clean interface with an intuitive drag-and-drop design.

nsync does not aim to provide many advanced features, thereby compromising with the quality of each because the producers of the software believe in providing the best out of what is actually required and in the best possible way.

== This is the nsync way ==

Here we present to you not just our product, but our vision too. We hope to make this yours as well and we promise it’ll take just 3 minutes of your time!

* *Be minimalistic*. The less there is on the interface, the better. Put what’s really needed up there.
* Don’t prompt, make intelligent guesses. Notify the users that we’ve made a guess and allow them to make their own decisions. Do this gently and unassumingly.
* Make it pretty. Packaging is important; make it eye-catching but not overly or offensively so.
* Understandable. No manual or instructions should be needed.
* Fast. Synchronization has to be fast.
* Stick to the above principles! We are engineers, designers and programmers, but above all, we’re users too. Put the user first.
