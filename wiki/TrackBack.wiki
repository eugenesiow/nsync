#summary TrackBack recovery.

= Introduction =

*!TrackBack* is a feature in nsync that ensures you are able to recover your directories to pre-sync state. It ensures that you never(unless there's a natural disaster of course) lose any files! If *reliability* is what you want, TrackBack seeks to provide this.

= How !TrackBack works =

  # Before every sync session, a back up file of the folder pair will be created for restoration purposes.
  # It's works like a time machine whereby it allows you to restore your files/folders of a particular day, e.g. Restore the folder version as on last Monday before sync was carried out on it.
  # TrackBack enables the user to restore the pre sync state of the last 5 saved folder pair versions. It all happens in just 1 click.
  # The user has the option to either restore only the left folder or the right folder or both.
  # TrackBack is disabled by default. A change in the Settings is required to enable it.
